# AppInventor_Metrics_Analyzer
Simple analyzer that extracts the most important metrics out of an AppInventor project.

## How it works

The Python script uses a CSV file containing all the blocks and their relative information of an AppInventor project and extracts a set of metrics. 

The metrics analyzer uses a file, called 'results.csv', generated by a parser written by Riccardo Felluga ( [Link to his repository](https://github.com/riccardofelluga/AppInventor_Parser)) and stores metrics to a file called 'metrics.csv'. 

The extracted metrics are  relative to components and to computational concepts (CC) blocks.

### Components 
 | Metric | Definition |
 | --- | --- |
 | Nr. of screens | Number of screens of the application |
 | Nr. of components by functionality | User interface, Media (sound is disregarded), Drawing, Sensors, Social, Storage, Connectivity) |
 | TNC | Total number of components: sum of all the values obtained for each component type  |
 | NOUB | Number of unique blocks |

### Computational Concepts (CC) blocks 
Six types of CC blocks are counted: procedure, variable, logic, loop, conditional and list.
